# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)

Note.destroy_all
# if you want to destroy_all, you need to destroy_all notes first otherwise it will throw an error 
# that you can't destroy destop since it has notes associated to it
# but it was fixed with "depedent destroy in models"
